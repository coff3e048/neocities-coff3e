        <h3>As the new era of online storage arises...</h3>
        <p>Lots of tiny, portable physical media is slowly being shunted out in favor of everywhere-you-go cloud storage. Eventually, they'll all come to the graveyard like the floppy disk, zipdisk, and digital disc.</p>
        <h3>How long are most formats going to stick around until we finally submit our souls to the cloud?</h3>
        <p>As far as I'm aware, things like external hard drives, solid state drives, and flash drives are going to keep sticking around for a pretty long time. Cloud storage <i>can</i> fit big files, but depending on your internet speed (which if you're the average dude, it's not going to be nearly as fast as physical) you're going to be waiting a very long time for that transfer. We're going to have wait a a <b>very</b> long time before that kind of storage starts making everytihng we own obselete (which by the time it does, physical storage will still be faster). In-house network storage is ever more popular and is likely best solution for keeping large amounts of data at a reasonable speed, which can absolutely use physical media for storing your crap.
