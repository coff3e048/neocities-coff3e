		<h2>What is "Free Software"?</h2>
		<br>
		<p>When you think of free software, the first thing you might think of is free as in "<em>Gratis</em>",
			or Free as in <em>Price</em>. This is not the free this page will be
			discussing. The free we are actually talking
			about is Free as in "<em>Libre</em>", or Free as in <em>Freedom</em>.</p>
		<br>
		<p>To use free software is to make a political and ethical choice
			asserting the right to learn, and share what we learn with others. Free
			software has become the foundation of a learning society where we share
			our knowledge in a way that others can build upon and enjoy. Not only
			that, Using free software comes with many benefits. You are free to
			modify the code in any way to your own liking, redistribute to
			another person, use commercially or in an enterprise environment, and
			far more depending on the license that software uses. Free software
			can also be far more secure than it's proprietary competitors. Anyone
			can test the code, find bugs or exploits, and push in patches for
			said bug or exploit.</p>
		<br>
		<p>Unfortunately, the opposite side to this is far more popular to
			average people usually without their awareness. This opposite side
			disallows any sharing, studying, or modification of such software or
			media, and will usually be behind a corporation that may spy on your
			activities or take personal information, and sometimes require a paid license
			to use or use commercially. This is called <em>Proprietary Software</em>. This includes software like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Sublime Text</li>
			<li>Adobe software</li>
			<li>Microsoft Windows</li>
			<li>Apple operating systems</li>
			<li>Google Chrome (Chromium is free software, Chrome is not).</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Websites can also fall under the category of <em>Proprietary Software</em>, which is far more common even if
			you're using free software to view them.</p>
		<p>Sites like:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Netflix</li>
			<li>Hulu</li>
			<li>Youtube</li>
			<li>Google (including Google services)</li>
			<li>CodeHS</li>
		</ul>
		<p>fall under the "<em>Proprietary</em>" class. This also includes sites
			that use DRM for content. An extension
			named <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/"><em>LibreJS</em></a>
			can prevent the execution of non-free JavaScript for websites.
			<br>
		<p>Many pieces of proprietary software also take use of free software,
			and there are pieces of some proprietary software that are open
			sourced. However, while it's still better than nothing, Its usually
			agreed upon that it isn't enough, and is still labeled as proprietary
			software, or "Half Open-Source".</p>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h2>What are some alternatives to common proprietary software?</h2>
		<p>There are many existing alternatives to certain common proprietary
			software, most of which exceed or come on-par to a feature
			level.
