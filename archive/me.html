	<h2>About Me</h2> 
	
	<p>My name is James Burns, but I'm usually called by my nickname: <em>Jake</em>. I am enrolled at the IT academy at Carencro High and want to pursue something into computer hardware or software. I am an active open source and computer enthusiast, and I advocate for the use of free software whenever possible.</p>

	<p>I love contributing computing power and resources to good causes, and hope to take more spots to do so. I self-host a lot of my internet-based services and applications through Linux. I hope to express my interests more through personal web pages soon, since I've dabbled in a little bit of HTML5 myself!</p>
	
	<p>In my free time, I usually talk with friends, play some video games, do techy stuff, mess with and use virtual machines, and watch shows, movies, and videos. </p>
 
	<h3>Internet-based projects I contribute to:</h3>
	<ul> 
		<li>The TOR project (<a href=https://www.torproject.org/>Torproject homepage</a>)</li>
		<li>Folding@Home (<a href=https://foldingathome.org/>Folding@Home homepage</a>)</li>
		<li>Prime95 GIMPS(<a href=https://www.mersenne.org/>Prime95 home page</a>)</li>
		<p> and hopefully soon more!
	</ul>
